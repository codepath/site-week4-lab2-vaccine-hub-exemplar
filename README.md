# Vaccine Registration Hub Lab

For this lab, you'll build the backend for a vaccine registration platform. The goal is to allow users to register for a vaccine with their credentials and login to check their appointment info.

You will use Node, Express, and PostgreSQL to develop an API that implements registration and login functionality. All data should be persisted to the PostgreSQL database and exposed to the user via API endpoints. The frontend is already set up to communicate with the API on port 3001, so you'll be responsible for creating the backend for this application.

First things first, navigate into the UI directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. Run `npm start` to start the frontend.
